# DataScienceSC
Repository for Data Science Assignments from Startup Campus. In this repository i have file ipynb from Google Colab about my Data Science assignments.

in that file, I did some different data processing (with Pandas) like groupby, aggregation, merging, usecols, sort values, loc, iloc, value counts, data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn. In addition, I also made a simple Machine Learning model to predict the status of "Termd" and answer several question.
